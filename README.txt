To execute Part I of this project:

1) Extract the zipped folder and enter the directory the folder is extracted to.
2) Go to the next level. You should be in the top-level directory (if you use 'ls' from this directory you should see many files, including 'part1.py').
3) Enter the command: 'python3 part1.py'. Please be sure to enter 'python3' and not 'python' as this code won't run on Python 2.7.

To execute Part II of this project:

2) Enter the command: 'python3 part2.py'. Please be sure to enter 'python3' and not 'python' as this code won't run on Python 2.7.
